## .NET Service Development Guidelines

1. **Consistent Naming Convention:** Ensure that the repository name **matches** the solution file name (excluding
   the `.sln` extension). This helps maintain clarity and organization within your project structure.
2. **Streamlined Pipeline Management:** Before pushing a service to GitHub, **carefully review and remove** any
   pipelines that are not relevant to the specific service being deployed. This repository is designed to include a
   comprehensive set of pipelines, but not all of them will be applicable to every service. By removing unused
   pipelines, you'll keep your workflow focused and efficient.
